  <h3>What is the Idea ?</h3>
<div>
	<p>I have used  <%= link_to 'Pomodoro Technique','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-z5kmVhzU'%> and found it to be quite effective in executing my ideas. Now the hard part was doing it more often. I plan to post my pomodoro data here so that I keep myself accountable. But to make things more rewarding  I would love someone to sponsor the pomodoros that I am completing. All the funds raised by this process will go to <%= link_to 'Oscar India','http://www.oscar-india.org' %> which is a NGO which is using football as a medium to educate kids. I mean what better way to marry three of my interests - Social entrepreneurship, football and productivity.
